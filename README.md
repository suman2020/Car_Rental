# Car_Rental_System
• Designed an Entity-Relationship model to define the elements and their relationship
for the car rental database system.

• Created a relational database management system using MySQL workbench which facilitates 
rental companies to keep track of the vehicles rented, customer’s information, 
billing amount details, along with the list of vehicles available for rent.

• Created a simple and user-friendly Graphical User Interface using MySQL Connector in
Python that allows rental companies to retrieve the desired rental information
by choosing the various query’s input parameters displayed in the UI
